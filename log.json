  "Okay, I have this set up finally. Worked for 4 hrs with gpt 3.5 last night just to get this going. \n\nI'm hoping to give enough love to my neglected projects that they will survive in the wild by themselves.",
  "It's not easy to get going and then once I get going I feel like I should stop because I've had to start over so much just by perfecting things. \nI guess I work with a lot of projects that are vulnerable to perfectionism.\n\nEither way, today my plan is to get this log onto the Github the way that it is. \n                \n      If it goes the way I want I can have a good log with a list of my local to-do's. Maybe I can make my OWN Jira like Kanban board... although I think a physical one might be better for me. \n\n      If I described all of the issues I had just STARTING this log, I would lose an hr. Oh man... DAYS if I really went into \"I first started to make a blog with a database..\"\n\n      Either way, thanks to Chat GPT for helping me out. It's just a lot quicker to get it going if you understand a little bit about it. I can tell it's in a spot where if I keep going I can get permanent results and that's EXACTLY what I am after."
